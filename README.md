HTML5/CSS/JS web app based on the game 2048.
All code and assets are authored by me and meant to be executed by any HTML5 compatible browser and device.

Features:
- 4 game modes;
- adaptable layout with automatic resizing;
- support for keyboard, mouse and touch/slide controls;
- smooth animations made entirely on vanilla CSS;
- local storage of highscores and game progress;
- minimal design made entirely through CSS sheets and DOM (no image files);
- standalone offline with no external assets;
- commented source code.

This project is intended as a learning experience by a beginner programmer.
